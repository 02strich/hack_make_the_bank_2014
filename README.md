Hack/Make the bank 2014
=======================

Simple payment platform developed at Hack/Make the Bank 2014 in Berlin. It supports the OpenBankProject OAuth flow as well as its payments API as far as it is implemented in the sandbox.

Motivation
----------
PSPs charge merchants quite a variety of fees while normal bank transfers pretty much free. By combining the access via the OpenBankProject with a awesome price of a wire, we provide merchants with a cheap an simple way to get payed.
